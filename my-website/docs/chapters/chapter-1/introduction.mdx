# Introduction

## Definition

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving beyond purely digital computation to encompass intelligent behavior in physical systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual environments, Physical AI integrates perception, reasoning, and action within real-world physical contexts. This field encompasses the development of intelligent systems that can understand, interact with, and manipulate the physical world through embodied agents such as robots, autonomous vehicles, and smart devices.

## Concept Breakdown

Physical AI combines several core disciplines to create systems that can operate effectively in the real world:

1. **Perception**: The ability to sense and interpret physical environments through various modalities including vision, touch, sound, and other sensory inputs.

2. **Reasoning**: The cognitive processes that allow systems to make decisions based on sensory input and environmental understanding.

3. **Action**: The physical manifestation of decisions through actuators, motors, and other mechanisms that can affect the physical world.

4. **Learning**: The capacity to improve performance through experience in physical environments.

The field emerged from the recognition that intelligence is fundamentally tied to embodiment and interaction with the physical world, challenging the traditional separation between digital computation and physical reality.

## Practical Examples

Consider a household robot tasked with cleaning: it must perceive obstacles, reason about the most efficient cleaning path, and physically navigate the environment while adapting to dynamic changes. This is a classic Physical AI application where the system must continuously integrate sensing, planning, and acting.

In the context of humanoid robotics, Physical AI enables robots to perform human-like tasks by understanding the physics of their environment and their own bodies. For example, a humanoid robot learning to pour coffee must understand fluid dynamics, grasp mechanics, and spatial relationships.

## Code Example

Here's a basic example of a Physical AI system using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) for a simple navigation task:

```python
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist
from sensor_msgs.msg import LaserScan
import math

class PhysicalAINavigator(Node):
    """
    A simple Physical AI navigator that demonstrates
    perception, reasoning, and action cycle
    """

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('physical_ai_navigator')

        # Publisher for robot movement commands
        self.cmd_vel_pub = self.create_publisher(Twist, 'cmd_vel', 10)

        # Subscriber for laser scanner data (perception)
        self.scan_sub = self.create_subscription(
            LaserScan,
            'scan',
            self.scan_callback,
            10
        )

        # Timer for reasoning and action cycle
        self.timer = self.create_timer(0.1, self.reason_and_act)

        self.obstacle_distance = float('inf')
        self.target_angle = 0.0

    def scan_callback(self, msg):
        """
        Process laser scan data to perceive obstacles
        """
        # Get the closest distance in front of the robot
        front_scan = msg.ranges[len(msg.ranges)//2 - 10:len(msg.ranges)//2 + 10]
        self.obstacle_distance = min(front_scan) if front_scan else float('inf')

        self.get_logger().info(f'Obstacle distance: {self.obstacle_distance:.2f}m')

    def reason_and_act(self):
        """
        Core reasoning and action cycle
        """
        cmd_msg = Twist()

        # Simple obstacle avoidance reasoning
        if self.obstacle_distance < 1.0:  # If obstacle is close
            cmd_msg.angular.z = 0.5  # Turn right
            cmd_msg.linear.x = 0.0   # Stop moving forward
        else:
            cmd_msg.linear.x = 0.5   # Move forward
            cmd_msg.angular.z = 0.0  # Don't turn

        self.cmd_vel_pub.publish(cmd_msg)

def main(args=None):
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    navigator = PhysicalAINavigator()

    try:
        rclpy.spin(navigator)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
    finally:
        navigator.destroy_node()
        rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

This code demonstrates the core Physical AI cycle: the robot perceives its environment through laser scanning, reasons about potential obstacles, and acts by adjusting its movement accordingly.

## Key Takeaways
